# minimalistBlog
Is what I call this project. I basically got inspired to create a lightweight blog because of a post I saw on LinkedIn.

It is hosted on a sub-domain which has a link to my Vercel page. Everytime I update this repository it gets pushed to Vercel which pushes it live. This way I can easily add and or delete blogposts.

# What's the endgoal?
I don't really have one yet. I'll just maintain this lightweight blog and see what I can create of it. I'll add my own challenges along the way to keep it more interesting.
Looking forward to see what I end up with.
