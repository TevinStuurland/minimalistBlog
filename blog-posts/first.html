							<p>
								I've created this little thing in about 2-3 days. I started coding after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/essasaulat_the-bear-minimum-building-a-simple-blog-activity-6701157418392457216-9ue2">a post on LinkedIn</a>	inspired me and now we're here.
							</p>
							<p>
								I wanted to do something simple and easy so I've created a <a target="_blank" href="https://bear.app/">Bear.app</a> account.
								This is a private markdown app on the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Through that I can write the simple ideas of concepts that I have for this... platform? No idea what it is yet.
							</p>

							<p>
								I can then export these posts to the github folder on my desktop through my phone (iCloud is quite handy), and then I can upload them 
								and clean up the blog posts on my mac.
							</p>

							<p>To make deployment even easier I've set-up a <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel server</a> that is linked to the github
								page that I previously spoke about, this I then linked to a subdomain and tadaaa you are reading the result of all that. And most of it happens automatic, the only 
								thing I really need to do is edit the post, commit & push it to github and the latter is literally 3 clicks for me. If all this sounds foreign to you then I've created this little graphic for you.
							</p>

								<img alt="my upload structure, first I create a post on my phone. Then I edit on my laptop, after that I upload it to Github, which then connects to a server and throws everything online." src="../media/structure.png"/>
							</figure>

							<p>
								You can expect me to fumble and try out some things along the way. I've never maintained a blog structure before, I was never 
								the type to really write down thoughts or give it more structure than needed. I think I will mostly
								talk about design, concepts, things that inspire me and perhaps if it get there small interviews with 
								some of my friends or acquaintances.
							</p>

							<p>
								I will be updating this as regularly as I can.
								Well, let's see how this goes!
