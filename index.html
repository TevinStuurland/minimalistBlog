	<div id="why">
		<h1>Why?</h1>
		<p>
			I wanted to try something new, refreshing and learn something along the way.
			Not a professional writer by any means, also not a chaser of stories just someone
			who likes to talk about different topics.
		</p>

		<p>
			It also helps me to have a side project that I can invest my time and attention towards.
			Within this small space, I want to grow and learn more about digital ettiquette and how I can 
			apply that to my own practices.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is also somewhat of a digital playground, it could have a blog structure today but 
			an entirely new structure tomorrow and that's fine. I just like to challenge myself to try new things
			so I don't remain stagnant as a person and as a designer.

	<div id="who">
		<h1>Who?</h1>
		<p>My name is Tevin Stuurland and I'm a <a target="_blank" href="https://stuurland.nl">designer</a> living in the Netherlands.
		I've been educating myself on design and it's different branches for pretty much the last decade. My current role is that of a Product
		Designer, but my interest expand further than that of one role a designer can take. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For example I have created <a target="_blank" href="https://stuurland.nl/projects/individuals.html">a digital experience for exposition visitors.</a>
			I also <a target="_blank" href="https://stuurland.nl/projects/discovery.html">created a design language and user interface</a> for the Netherlands Cancer Institute,
			and I <a target="_blank" href="https://stuurland.nl/projects/postnl.html">helped PostNL with creating a new interface</a> for their pick up and mail vending machine.
